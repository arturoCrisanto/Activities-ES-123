# Activity: Interactive Python Program with Conditional Logic

---

## Instructions:

1. Create a new Python file in VS Code named `activity1.py`.
2. Write a Python script that does the following:
   - Asks the user for their name and age.
   - Checks if the user is 18 years old or older and prints a message:
     - If 18 or older, print: "Hello, [name]! You are an adult."
     - If under 18, print: "Hello, [name]! You are still a minor."
   - Uses both single-line and multi-line comments to explain parts of the code.
   - Follows proper indentation and variable naming conventions.

### Example Output
