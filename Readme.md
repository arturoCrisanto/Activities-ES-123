# Python String Manipulation Activity

## Instructions:

### Write a Python program that does the following:

1. Take a `user input` of a sentence.
2. Slice the `first five characters` from the input and display them.
3. Replace all occurrences of the letter `"a"` with `"@"`.
4. Convert the entire string to `uppercase`.
5. `Split` the sentence into a list of words.
6. Concatenate the `first` and `last` words from the list to form a new word.
7. Display all the results.

Example Result:

```bash
Enter a sentence: Python is an amazing language
Sliced (first 5 characters): Pytho
Replaced 'a' with '@': Python is @n @m@zing l@ngu@ge
Uppercase: PYTHON IS AN AMAZING LANGUAGE
Split words: ['Python', 'is', 'an', 'amazing', 'language']
Concatenated first and last words: Pythonlanguage
```
